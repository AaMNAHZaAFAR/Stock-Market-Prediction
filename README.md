# Stock Market Prediction Using RNN, LSTM, and GRU
# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting stock market prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The aim of this project is to predict stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques and perform a comparative analysis of their performance.

# Dataset
**Input Format**<br/>
Stock Market Data: I will be utilizing Kaggle's platform, which offers public license to datasets. The dataset is available at the following link: NYSE Dataset on Kaggle. The dataset is in CSV format with four files but i am going to use one of them i.e. prices-split-adjusted.csv.<br/>
**Output Format**<br/>
Predicted Stock Prices: The output will be presented graphically thorough plots containing the actual and predicted closing prices.<br/>
