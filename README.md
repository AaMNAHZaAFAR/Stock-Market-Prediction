# Stock Market Prediction Using RNN, LSTM, and GRU
# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting stock market prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The aim of this project is to predict stock prices using advanced machine learning techniques and perform a comparative analysis of their performance.

**Prerequisites**
Install requirements.txt file to make sure correct versions of libraries are being used.<br/>
Python 3.5.x<br/>
TensorFlow 1.10.0<br/>
Numpy 1.15.0<br/>

# Project Structure
**data/**: Directory containing stock market datasets.<br/>
**src/:** Source code for data preprocessing, model implementation, training, and evaluation.<br/>
**notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.<br/>
**reports/:** Directory for project reports and documentation.<br/>
**models/:** Saved models and training checkpoints.<br/>

# Dataset
**Input Format**<br/>
Stock Market Data: I will be utilizing Kaggle's platform, which offers public license to datasets. The dataset is available at the following link: NYSE Dataset on Kaggle. The dataset is in CSV format with four files but i am going to use two of them prices.csv and prices-split-adjusted.csv.<br/>
**Output Format**<br/>
Predicted Stock Prices: The output will be presented graphically thorough plots and histogram containing the date and predicted closing prices.<br/>
